# Project 1: Maven Olympics Challenge
Worked on a datasets that covered the many of the Olympics since inception until Olympics 2020. 
It was my first work and challenge after taking a course on using Power BI Desktop and Excel Pivot Tables.  
The visuals were developed Excel Pivot Tables. 
The analytics discovered striking insights on countries in the Olympics, Medals won, location, events and a whole lot.
